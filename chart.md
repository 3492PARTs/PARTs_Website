# bar chart (& box plots? & stacked bars?) line graph

- averages
-- how often someone makes it
-- requires a second input for failures
---- maybe think about input where they click when piece picked up and another for when scored?
-- for number inputs
-- for time inputs
-- i think everything in a flow can be an average

- percentages
-- this will be computed across matches
-- for boolean indicators ?

- fastest
- min maxes

# heat map

- requires image of field
-- track things like 
---- scoring locations
---- pick up locations
---- starting positions
---- auto collect locations
