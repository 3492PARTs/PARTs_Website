    <h1>The Opportunity</h1>
    <p>To meet its financial needs, the team depends on corporate and business sponsors, personal donations, and
      fundraising events. The team has held events at local restaurants, sold items such as food and bumper stickers,
      and opened a GoFundMe account. Expenses for the team include the cost of robot components, event registration
      fees, travel expenses, hotels, meals, competition shirts, and other miscellaneous items (e.g., flags, signs,
      badges).</p>
    <p>We greatly appreciate your consideration and support for our organization. We hope that you join us in continuing
      to build a strong team of intelligent, responsible, and motivated students.</p>
