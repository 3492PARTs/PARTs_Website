<app-box [Title]="'What is \'Gracious Professionalism\' and \'Coopertition\'?'">
  <p>Gracious Professionalism is the FIRST idea that combined the notions of mutual gain and fierce
    competition in a relationship that benefits both the team and the community. "Knowledge, competition, and
    empathy are comfortably blended" in the theory of Gracious Professionalism.</p>
  <p>Coopertition is showing kindness and dignity in the face of competition. It involves learning from your
    team. Teaching your friends. Learning from mentors. Coopertition is truly the essence of what FIRST is all
    about.</p>
