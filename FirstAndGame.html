									<h2>What is FIRST?</h2>
									<p>FIRST Robotics is an organization that was founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen. The mission of FIRST is to, "...inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership..." (USFIRST website). It offers opportunities for scholarships and promotes good sportsmanship and cooperation.</p>
									<h2>What does FIRST stand for?</h2>
									<ul>
										<li><p>For</p></li>
										<li><p>Inspiration and</p></li>
										<li><p>Recognition of</p></li>
										<li><p>Science and</p></li>
										<li><p>Technology</p></li>
									</ul>
									<h2>What is 'Gracious Professionalism' and 'Coopertition'?</h2>
									<p>Gracious Professionalism is the FIRST idea that combined the notions of mutual gain and fierce competition in a relationship that benefits both the team and the community. "Knowledge, competition, and empathy are comfortably blended" in the theory of Gracious Professionalism.</p>
									<p>Coopertition is showing kindness and dignity in the face of competition. It involves learning from your team. Teaching your friends. Learning from mentors. Coopertition is truly the essence of what FIRST is all about.</p>
									<h2>How does FIRST impact students?</h2>
									<p>When compared with students not involved in FIRST, FIRST students are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><p>More than 3 times as likely to major specifically in engineering.</p></li>
										<li><p>Roughly 10 times as likely to have had an apprenticeship, internship, or co-op job in their freshman year.</p></li>
										<li><p>Significantly more likely to expect to achieve a post graduate degree.</p></li>
										<li><p>More than twice as likely to expect to pursue a career in science and technology.</p></li>
										<li><p>Nearly 4 times as likely to expect to pursue a career specifically in engineering.</p></li>
										<li><p>More than twice as likely to volunteer in their communities."</p></li>
									</ul>
									<p>FIRST really does help students achieve a future beneficial to them!</p>

									<h2>2016 Game <strong>FIRST STRONGHOLD</strong></h2>
									<p>FIRST STRONGHOLD is played by two alliances of three teams each. Alliances compete against each other to breach their opponents' defenses, known as outer works, and capture their tower. They score points by crossing elements of their opponents' outer works, scoring boulders in their opponents' tower goals, and surrounding and scaling their opponents' tower itself.</p>
