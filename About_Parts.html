						<h1>A Brief History...<h1/>
						<p>P.A.R.T.s, formerly known as RoboGens, began its career as a robotics team in 2010 when a Winfield High School senior, Taylor Shank, attended a Mountaineer Area RoboticS (MARS) event. Awed and inspired, Taylor moved to create a team at his school. Denise Johnson, a teacher at the school, took up the opportunity as the sponsor, and the team RoboGens was born. It was originally called this because Winfield High School is the home of the Winfield Generals, and we wanted to pay a tribute to the school. We also named our robot "McCoy" for the 2010-2011 season in honor of one of the most respected faculty members at Winfield High, Coach Leon McCoy.</p>
						<h1>Now...</h1>
						<p>P.A.R.T.s is a team of 30 high school students from all over Putnam County who come together to build robots and promote S.T.E.M. P.A.R.T.s has worked with our school board of education to provide students on our team with academic credit.</p>
